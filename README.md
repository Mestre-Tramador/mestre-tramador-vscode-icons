# Mestre Tramador's VS Code Icons

This is a simple set of `svg` icons to use alongside the [vscode-icons](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vscode-icons-team.vscode-icons) VS Code extension.

## Installation

To use my icons you can follow the already very easy and perfectly explained tutorial of the extensions, which you can find [here](https://github.com/vscode-icons/vscode-icons/wiki/Custom).

## Contribution

I made this a public repository if anyone wants to increase the customization of theirs VS Codes, and my goal is not to promote any kind of direct contribution to the creators of the extension right now, but anyone is free to get to use my icons! ðŸ˜„

If is your desire, feel free to fork this repository and go with your customization!
